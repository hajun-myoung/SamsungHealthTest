# Temporary Stopped Project

> Note :

I've checked this note too late

## Process

1. Look the official documentation up

1. Install the SDK

    - It was not an easy way

    - You need to download the SDK file manually, copy it proper directory

    - And you must set the SDK in you android project

1. Code with Kotlin(given official docu is wrote by JAVA)

1. Look up for find error

## Result

In the `README.md` file that sealed with SDK file,  

> ** To work properly with Samsung Health, please apply for a partner program at http://developer.samsung.com/health/android. ** 

But, in the middle of site...

> Note :  
> We are currently going through an update to better support our partners.  
> For that reason, we will not be accepting any applications for the Partner Apps Program at this time.  

So, **You can't import the SDK for now(Jul 19, 2023)**

## Feedback

Samsung, you need to fill the color of that "Note" box with red,  
and move it to the top of the documents.
